# TMEM Linear Generalization Initiative

This directory is the durable coordination space for the TMEM linear-layout
generalization project.

Keep this README up to date when the role of any document changes, when a new
current-state handoff supersedes an older one, or when the source-of-truth
entry points change.

## How To Use This Folder

When resuming the initiative:
- start here;
- then read `memory.md` as the initiative's durable memory/source of truth;
- use `gb200_nvidia_ci_inventory.md` for the current GB200/NVIDIA CI baseline
  and confirmed red list;
- use `gb200_failure_manifest.md` plus the adjacent generated `.txt` files
  when you need the exact nodeid inventories for the current branch or the
  merge-base-existing shard-3 subsets;
- use `gb200_branch_recovery_plan.md` when you need the prioritized
  branch-caused recovery backlog and the exact representative repros to drive
  fixes;
- then read the tail of the active handoff for the latest live buckets and next
  concrete steps;
- use `log.md` for chronological provenance and validation history; and
- use `fuzz_plan.md` once the current planner/cleanup blockers are green and
  broad saturation work is the next task.

## Current Project Invariant

- `_reinterpret` is not an escape hatch for relying on whichever physical TMEM
  lowering the compiler happens to choose.
- Production kernels, examples, and tests that currently depend on private
  `_reinterpret` behavior or compiler-specific physical-layout knowledge are
  migration targets.
- The intended replacement is a supported descriptor operation sequence:
  offset/slice/subview to the desired physical TMEM bits, then bitcast to the
  desired dtype/shape/layout only when the bitcast preserves the exact physical
  mapping and total size.
- Lowering-side fixes are still appropriate for supported APIs that miscompile,
  but do not add ad-hoc selectors just to preserve old `_reinterpret`
  accidents.

## Current Checkpoint

- As of 2026-04-11 13:05 UTC, the latest validated current-branch checkpoint is
  `be3cba0cd` on `origin/codex/tmem`; the latest source-changing checkpoint is
  still `85d8dbbf4`.
- A fresh four-way `python/test/gluon` sweep from `be3cba0cd` is green:
  - group 1:
    `5448 passed, 1002 skipped, 19348 deselected`
  - group 2:
    `2666 passed, 3784 skipped, 19348 deselected`
  - group 3:
    `4408 passed, 2041 skipped, 19348 deselected, 1 xfailed`
  - group 4:
    `5582 passed, 866 skipped, 19350 deselected`
  - the current `gb200_current_branch_group{1,2,3,4}_latest_failures.txt`
    manifests are refreshed to `0` nodeids.
- Groups 3 and 4 still printed noisy `.kind::i8` PTX assembler diagnostics
  while continuing to final green pytest summaries. Treat those as
  nonfailing/xfailed-path output unless a focused exact rerun reports a failed
  nodeid.
- The supported M64 subview/physical-bitcast slice is now checkpointed:
  - `47a07a37d` added normalized source-query inversion for physical bitcast
    views whose source subview keeps inactive zero support bases;
  - `85d8dbbf4` preserved out-of-range physical row/col origins for narrowed
    subviews, migrated the M64 `_reinterpret` tests to supported
    `slice/subview -> bitcast` where the mapping is equivalent, and made
    parameterized kernels pass layouts as explicit constexpr arguments so
    Gluon cache keys distinguish legacy and linear variants.
- The wider grouped `python/test/gluon` group-3 rerun that started before
  these two checkpoints is now superseded by the green group-3 rerun above. It
  had reduced the stale current-head red set to:
  - `test_tmem_subslice_block_m_64_parent_layout[linear]`;
  - `test_block_m_64_mma[legacy]`;
  - `test_block_m_64_mma[linear]`;
  - result: `3 failed, 4406 passed, 2041 skipped, 19348 deselected`.
- Focused current-head reruns after `85d8dbbf4` close that exact M64 set:
  - subview/physical-bitcast exacts:
    `4 passed`;
  - `test_block_m_64_mma[legacy]` / `[linear]`:
    `1 passed, 1 xfailed`;
  - the xfail is deliberate design debt for legacy M64 `64x64` layout sugar
    lacking producer-visible physical-family semantics for MMAv5 consumers;
    the linear supported layout passes in the same process.
- The supported descriptor bitcast API remains on the branch, but the
  attention example migration has been intentionally reverted for now:
  - `python/examples/gluon/01-attention-forward.py` is back to its pre-bitcast
    `_reinterpret` form;
  - the representative attention exact is red again with
    `LLVM ERROR: Invalid basis 32 for in-dim 'col' and out-dim 'dim1'`;
  - the old examples/Gluon green aggregate at `4263ae61` / `49f1a0fd` is
    stale for current `HEAD`;
  - future attention work must use a synchronization-aware supported
    `offset/slice/subview -> bitcast` sequence, not private `_reinterpret`
    behavior or lowering selectors.
- The stale `test_mma_shared_inputs` two-CTA TTGIR spelling bucket is closed:
  - current TMEM encoding text may spell the type field as `twoCTAs`, while
    physical-layout and op attributes still use `two_ctas`;
  - the assertion now accepts either spelling;
  - patched four-way `test_mma_shared_inputs` refresh:
    `3830 passed, 490 skipped`, `2954 passed, 1366 skipped`,
    `1206 passed, 3114 skipped`, and `2584 passed, 1736 skipped`.
- The focused persistent `python/triton_kernels/tests/test_matmul.py`
  shared-memory OOR bucket is fixed, and the full directory now has a green
  current-head rerun:
  - root cause was ordinary replayed `ttng.tmem_subslice` loads/stores using
    the exact preserved physical query and therefore selecting a root-width
    register family for a shape-local replay slice;
  - replayed subslices now use the subview-local descriptor type for register
    layout selection;
  - only explicit `tmem_physical_bitcast` roots use the preserved physical
    query, keeping the supported physical bitcast contract intact.
- Validation for the latest code checkpoint:
  - build: `PASSED`
  - lit `tmem_layouts.mlir` and `tritongpu_to_llvm_blackwell.mlir`:
    `2 passed`
  - representative persistent matmul OOR repro:
    `1 passed`, metadata back to `shared=214120`
  - focused persistent fp8/mxfp4 matmul slice:
    `16 passed, 6 skipped`
  - full 4-way `python/triton_kernels/tests` refresh:
    `2377 passed, 3444 skipped`
- The M64 row/col-permuted split-N direct ld/st bucket remains closed as a
  positive hardware surface:
  - exact row-permuted `16x32bx2` warp anchors that would lower to misaligned
    one-row PTX addresses are rejected;
  - simple row/col-permuted `64xN` f32 TMEM-linear roots select the canonical
    aligned M64 split-N register layout;
  - backend default-layout selection has the same fallback, so conversions do
    not hit the empty-compatible-layout assertion.
- The full `python/test/gluon/test_tmem_runtime_matrix.py` file was refreshed
  from this branch:
  - full-file rerun before the final assertion refresh:
    `1437 passed, 354 skipped, 1 failed in 1226.69s`;
  - the only failure was a stale TTGIR text assertion in
    `test_tmem_runtime_matrix_cp_no_scales_indexed_view_canonicalized[128]`;
  - that test now checks the stable `ttng.tmem_physical_layout` marker on the
    legacy `tensor_memory_encoding` view path, and the exact nodeid rerun
    passes.
- The old `413`-nodeid branch-added runtime-matrix manifest is now refreshed
  to empty:
  - `gb200_current_branch_test_tmem_runtime_matrix_focus_e70a3aa09_failures.txt`
- The old `332`-nodeid focused `test_core.py` TMEM/MMA manifest is also now
  refreshed to empty:
  - the full focused manifest rerun passed:
    - `332 passed in 125.78s`
  - the only intermediate issues were stale expectations for:
    - the row-encoded `1048576` PTX offset in the legacy `64x128` split-N
      roundtrip;
    - the current clean unsupported descriptor-view diagnostic for a block
      basis `ld.red` negative.
  - `gb200_current_branch_test_core_group3_focus_e70a3aa09_failures.txt`
- The supported `_reinterpret` migration invariant remains:
  - offset to the right TMEM region;
  - slice/subview to the desired physical bits;
  - bitcast to the desired dtype/shape/layout only when equal-size and
    physical-mapping equivalent to the input descriptor.
- Next required durable step: continue the remaining recovery queue with the
  intentionally reverted attention example tracked separately from supported
  bitcast API validation and the legacy M64 MMAv5 xfail visible as design debt.
  After that, continue the long-term `ld.red`, `copy`/`warpx2`,
  MMAv5/`mma_scaled`, and fuzzing phases.

## Document Roles

- `memory.md`
  - durable memory for the initiative
  - source of truth for mission, current decisions, long-term plan, and current
    undated priorities
  - future sessions should update this when the stable plan or current
    priorities change

- `log.md`
  - append-only chronology of checkpoints, bug classification, validation, and
    conclusions
  - do not rewrite old entries except for obvious factual corrections

- `handoff_2026-04-09.md`
  - current active handoff
  - read its tail first for the latest live buckets, disproved experiments, and
    next implementation order
  - keep it updated at meaningful checkpoints and before likely context
    rollover

- `gb200_nvidia_ci_inventory.md`
  - current GB200/NVIDIA CI baseline for this Blackwell devbox phase
  - records the workflow coverage, confirmed red list, and classification of
    each current failure as stale expectation, rewrite-candidate, or real bug
  - update it before broadening beyond exact nodeids or changing the current
    CI-grounded failure story

- `gb200_failure_manifest.md`
  - index for the generated exact current-branch failure lists and the
    merge-base-existing shard-3 subsets
  - use the adjacent `.txt` files when you need exact nodeids rather than
    prose summaries
  - refresh the manifests whenever the current-branch failure surface changes
    materially

- `gb200_branch_recovery_plan.md`
  - prioritized recovery backlog for restoring GB200 CI parity with main
  - separates real branch regressions from preexisting failures, stale
    negatives, and reinterpret-contract rewrite candidates
  - use it to choose the next fix slice once the GB200 census is current

- `fuzz_plan.md`
  - operational saturation/fuzzing playbook for the broader `tcgen05` surface
  - not the immediate source of truth for current bug-fix priority while the
    shared-planner / legacy-unification / reinterpret-decomposition work is
    still active

- `handoff_2026-03-26.md`
  - historical handoff from an earlier phase of the initiative
  - archival provenance, not current status

- `next_agent_prompt_2026-03-26.md`
  - archived takeover prompt from an earlier managed-session workflow
  - archival only

## Current Session Discipline

- Keep `memory.md`, the active handoff, and this README aligned.
- Treat `memory.md` as memory: if the stable understanding of the project or
  the current undated execution priorities changes, update `memory.md` rather
  than leaving that knowledge only in chat context.
- Keep dated historical analyses in `log.md` and the dated handoff files
  instead of rewriting old reports in place.
